# SC2 Planner Bot Generator

Use this repo to have the [sharpy-sc2](https://github.com/DrInfy/sharpy-sc2) framework run a Starcraft 2 build generated by BurnySC2's [SC2 Planner](https://burnysc2.github.io/sc2-planner/).

## Work in progress
This is a work in progress and is here initially to provide a proof of concept to illustrate the potential of using sharpy-sc2 in collaboration with sc2-planner to rapidly generate bots.

**Some extremely basic actions aren't translated properly yet, such as transferring workers to gas.**

Please feel free to take this code and improve it for your own needs. Pull requests are also welcome :)

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.10 (other versions may work but are untested)
- Starcraft 2

### Install
1. Clone this project by doing a recursive clone:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive <GIT_URL>
    ```
   If you have already done a non-recursive clone, you can initialize missing any submodules like so:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Install Python 3.10 (other versions may work but are untested)
3. Install pip requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the example build order to test everything works.
   Before running this build you will either need the Royal Blood AIE map* installed or modify the run.py file to use a different map.
   ```bash
   python run.py example_build_order.json
   ```
   If it works, you should notice sharpy printing logs to the console like so:
   ```bash

   ```
   
   _* Royal Blood AIE map can be downloaded as part of the [Sc2 AI Arena 2023 Season 2 map pool](https://aiarena.net/wiki/184/plugin/attachments/download/21/)_


## Run your own build
1. Go to [sc2-planner](https://burnysc2.github.io/sc2-planner/).
2. Create a build order. _Note that sharpy-sc2 needs at least one worker unit in the build order to correctly identify the race._
3. Click "Export", "Copy SC2 bot instructions".
4. Paste the instructions into a file, e.g. `build_order.json`.
5. Run `python run.py <path_to_your_build_order_json_file>`
